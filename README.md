WellTrak Multi 
===========
### (Experimental)

Frustrated with how the Java project for WellTrak Multi was going in terms of a good looking, smoothly integrated front end, I decided to give PhoneGap a try, in hopes that as an added bonus it would be cross platform capable.

## Using frameworks jpHolo, PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile

* [jpHolo](http://www.teusink.eu/2013/04/android-example-app-with-phonegap-and.html) is an Android holo inspired theme built on PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile.

* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) is a "free and open source framework that allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs for the platforms you care about."

* [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com) jQuery Mobile is a "HTML5-based user interface system designed to make responsive web sites and apps that are accessible on all smartphone, tablet and desktop devices."

## Developed on my phone
Using [AIDE PhoneGap](http://www.android-ide.com/blog/2013/08/14/new-aide-for-phonegap-slash-cordova/) for an IDE, [DroidEdit](http://www.droidedit.com/), [Pocket Git](http://pocketgit.com/) for additional editing and git tools, and [Writeily Pro](http://writeily.me/) for markdown.
